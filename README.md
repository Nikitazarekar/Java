# Hospital Management System

## Project Overview

This project is a **Hospital Management System** implemented in Java.
It allows managing patient information efficiently in a hospital setting.
Users can **add, search, discharge, and display patients** using a simple console interface.
The system demonstrates **object-oriented programming concepts** like classes, objects, and encapsulation.
It is designed to be **easy to use and understand** for beginners learning Java.

## Features

* Add new patients with details like **ID, Name, Age, and Disease**.
* Display a **list of all patients** in the hospital.
* Search for a patient using their **unique ID**.
* Discharge a patient and remove them from the system.
* Display **currently admitted patients** at any given time.

## Classes and Methods

* **Patient (Class)**: Stores patient information with methods to access and modify data.
* **PatientDetails (Class)**: Manages an array of Patient objects with methods like `addPatient()`, `displayAll()`, `SearchById()`, `DischargePatient()`, and `AdmittedPatient()`.
* **HospitalManagementSystem (Class)**: Contains the `main` method and provides a **menu-driven interface** for user interaction.
* Demonstrates **encapsulation** by using private attributes with getters and setters.
* Uses **arrays** to store patient objects and keeps track of the total count.

## How to Use

1. Run the `HospitalManagementSystem` class to start the application.
2. Use the menu to **add new patients**, display all patients, search by ID, or discharge a patient.
3. Enter the **required patient details** when prompted.
4. Select the **appropriate option** to view admitted patients or exit the system.
5. The system will show messages confirming actions like **patient added** or **discharged successfully**.

## Sample Output

```
------Hospital Management System--------
1.Add Patient
2.Display All Patient
3.Search Patient by ID
4.Discharge Patient
5.Display Admitted Patients
6.Exit
Enter your choice: 
1
Enter Patient Id,Name,age and disease:
101 John 25 Fever
Patient Added Successfully

Enter your choice:
2
Patient [id=101, name=John, age=25, disease=Fever, isAdmitted=false]

Enter your choice:
3
Enter ID
101
Found
Patient [id=101, name=John, age=25, disease=Fever, isAdmitted=false]
```

## Learning Outcomes

* Understand **object-oriented programming** with a real-world example.
* Learn **array management** and dynamic object storage in Java.
* Practice creating **menu-driven console applications**.
* Understand **encapsulation and data access** using getters and setters.
* Gain experience in **handling basic operations** like add, search, and delete in a system.

**# Bank Management System**

## Project Overview

This project is a simple **Bank Management System** implemented in Java.
It demonstrates the use of **interfaces**, **classes**, **polymorphism**, and **method overriding**.
The system supports two types of bank accounts: **Saving Account** and **Fixed Deposit Account**.
Users can perform basic operations like **deposit**, **withdraw**, and **calculate interest**.
It helps understand **OOP concepts in Java** with a practical, real-world example.

## Features

* Create and manage **Saving Accounts** and **Fixed Deposit Accounts**.
* **Deposit money** into an account.
* **Withdraw money** with a check for sufficient balance.
* **Calculate interest** automatically based on account type.
* Display account details in a **clear and user-friendly format**.

## Classes and Interface

* **BankAccount (Interface)**: Declares common methods like `calInterest()` and `display()`.
* **SavingAccount (Class)**: Implements `BankAccount` for a savings account with 4% interest.
* **FixDeposite (Class)**: Implements `BankAccount` for a fixed deposit account with 7% interest.
* **Tester (Class)**: Contains the `main` method to demonstrate functionality.
* Demonstrates **polymorphism** by using interface references for different account objects.

## How to Use

1. Create objects of `SavingAccount` or `FixDeposite` using the constructor.
2. Use `deposite(amount)` to add money to the account.
3. Use `withdraw(amount)` to remove money (balance must be sufficient).
4. Call `calInterest()` to calculate interest for the account.
5. Call `display()` to show account details and interest.

## Sample Output

```
Account holder Name: ABC
Account No: 1001
Interest rate: 400.0
5000 deposited successfully !

Account holder Name: PQR
Account No: 2001
Interest rate: 1750.0
Insufficient funds
```

* For **SavingAccount**, the interest is calculated as `balance * 0.04`.
* For **FixDeposite**, the interest is calculated as `balance * 0.07`.
* Withdrawals check for sufficient balance to avoid negative amounts.

## Learning Outcomes

* Understand **interfaces and their implementation** in Java.
* Learn **method overriding** and polymorphism with real-world examples.
* Practice **basic banking operations** programmatically.
* Understand **interest calculation logic** for different account types.
* Gain experience in writing **modular and maintainable code**.
